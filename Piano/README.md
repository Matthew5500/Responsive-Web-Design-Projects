# Project #13 - Reviewing Responsive Web Design by Building a Piano
In this project, I applied responsive design principles to create a functional piano layout. By utilizing CSS and responsive design techniques, I ensured the piano adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. The project emphasizes the use of media queries and pseudo-selectors to achieve a dynamic and responsive web page. This exercise reinforces key concepts of responsive web design, demonstrating how to build interactive and adaptable user interfaces that provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of creating flexible layouts and enhancing user experience in web design.
