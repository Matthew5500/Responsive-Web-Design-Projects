# Project #18 - Reviewing CSS Animation by Building a Ferris Wheel
In this project, I explored the use of CSS animation to create an interactive and visually appealing Ferris wheel. Through a combination of HTML and CSS, I animated the rotation of the Ferris wheel and the movement of its cabins, demonstrating the power of CSS to bring web elements to life. This project emphasizes the application of CSS animations and transforms to enhance user engagement. By adjusting the speed and effects of the animations, I learned how to effectively draw attention to specific sections of a webpage. This exercise reinforced my skills in creating dynamic web designs that captivate and retain the user's interest.
