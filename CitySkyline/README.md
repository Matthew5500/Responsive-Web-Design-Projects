# Project #15 - Reviewing CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline
In this project, I explored the power of CSS variables by constructing a dynamic city skyline. This project showcases how to use CSS variables to manage and reuse styles efficiently, simplifying the process of making global style changes. By configuring CSS variables for different building and window colors, I demonstrated the flexibility and maintainability that CSS variables offer. This exercise not only reinforces fundamental CSS skills but also highlights advanced techniques for creating visually engaging and responsive designs. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to use CSS variables to enhance the scalability and readability of style sheets.
