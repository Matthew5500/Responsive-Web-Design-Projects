# Project #5 - Survey Form
In this project, I created a survey form that includes fields for name, age, email, phone number, and address, along with dropdowns, radio buttons, and checkboxes for additional information. I styled the form with modern CSS, featuring a semi-transparent dark mode background and a fixed image for added visual appeal.
