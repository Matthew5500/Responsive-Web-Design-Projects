# Project #19 - Reviewing CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin
In this project, I delved into the capabilities of CSS transforms to create an engaging and dynamic penguin character. Using a mix of HTML and CSS, I positioned and resized various elements to construct the penguin, crafted a scenic background, and introduced animations to enhance the visual appeal. This project highlights the practical use of CSS transforms for rotating, scaling, and animating elements. Through this exercise, I strengthened my understanding of how to use CSS transforms to build interactive and visually captivating web components. This project also honed my skills in creating animations and achieving a cohesive design that captures the viewer's attention.
