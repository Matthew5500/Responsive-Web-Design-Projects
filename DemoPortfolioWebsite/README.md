# Project #20 - Demo Portfolio Website
In this project, I crafted a demo portfolio website that serves as a blueprint for my future professional site. Through HTML, CSS, and the integration of Font Awesome icons, I designed a sleek and responsive layout. The site features a navigation menu with smooth scrolling, ensuring seamless user experience across devices. Sections such as "About Me," "Skills," and "Projects" showcase my expertise in Information Technology, highlighting technical proficiency in programming languages and agile methodologies. With attention to detail in design and functionality, this project sets the stage for a polished online presence to showcase my skills and achievements effectively.
